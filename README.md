# Assignment to test Web UI and REST API

This project fetches weather data from the following sources:

1. https://www.accuweather.com
2. https://openweathermap.org

## Goals

1. Fetch the current temperature for a given city from accuweather.com using
   the web UI
2. Fetch the current temperature for the same city using a REST API from
   openweathermap.org
3. Compare the temperature from the two sources and check for the variance
4. Throw a custom exception if the variance exceeds a given threshold
